Consul ACLs (Access Control Lists) provide a fine-grained security framework that controls access to Consul’s data and APIs. They define who can perform what actions within the system by issuing tokens associated with specific policies. Each token carries one or more policies that grant permissions to read or write certain resources—such as services, nodes, KV data, or sessions—at different scopes. When ACLs are enabled, every request to the Consul agent or server must include a valid token; otherwise, access is denied. This mechanism enforces the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only authorized users, services, or agents can interact with Consul’s catalog and configuration data, thereby securing the cluster against unauthorized operations.
