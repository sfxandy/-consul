To accelerate Quartz Modernisation, we built our own Consul control plane to give every service a consistent, secure way to find, talk to, and observe each other across Kubernetes, VMs, and legacy hosts. Owning the control plane lets us bake in zero-trust by default (mTLS, identity-based policies), golden-path templates, and GitOps automation that fit our compliance and hybrid estateâ€”without vendor lock-in or rewrites. It de-risks cutovers with canaries/blue-green, standardises timeouts/retries/circuit-breakers, and centralises health, metrics, and tracing. Net result: faster migrations, safer releases, fewer networking tickets, and a stable platform foundation for modernising Quartz at pace.
